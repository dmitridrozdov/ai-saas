const prompt = `Please analyze the design and user interface of the following React TypeScript component and provide a detailed assessment. Focus on aspects such as:

* **Visual Hierarchy and Consistency:** Evaluate the use of typography, spacing, and visual grouping. Are elements logically organized and easy to navigate? Is there a consistent design language throughout the page?
* **User Experience (UX):** Assess the usability of interactive elements (buttons, input fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, textarea). Is the feedback clear and intuitive? Are loading and error states handled effectively?
* **Accessibility:** Consider accessibility standards (e.g., proper labeling, keyboard navigation, color contrast).
* **Responsiveness:** Evaluate how well the design adapts to different screen sizes.
* **Code Quality (from a design perspective):** Comment on the use of Tailwind CSS classes and the overall structure of the JSX. Are there any opportunities for improvement in terms of componentization or code readability?
* **Sliding Panel Design:** Assess the visual design and user experience of the sliding panel for AI-generated unit tests. Is the feedback clear and informative?

Based on your analysis, provide a summary assessment of the design using one of the following tags: <result>Good</result>, <result>Bad</result>, or <result>Poor</result>. If the design falls between these categories, provide a more nuanced description within the <result> tag.

Here is the code of the file for your analysis:`;

    const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-2.0-flash"});
